## Notebooks
There are several notebooks in this series of demos that outline the application of BERT4Rec to MovieLens and Amazon review datasets. In particular, the included notebooks are as follows: 

1. **movieLens1m_preprocessing**: Download [MovieLens1m](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) data, preprocess and split into train, validation and test sets.
2. **amazon_preprocessing**: Download [Amazon](https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) data, preprocess and split into train, validation and test sets.
3. **bert4rec**: Train and evaluate [BERT4Rec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06690), a sequence-aware recommendation system with bidirectional encoder representations from transformer.
